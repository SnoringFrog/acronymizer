Acronymizer
===========

Make acronyms out of input.
___________

This is just a dumb little program to make acronyms quickly. Eventually (maybe) with support for selecting the case of the output.

It also might just turn into an excuse to implement something simple/stupid in random languages, like the current [Retina](https://github.com/m-ender/retina) versions.
